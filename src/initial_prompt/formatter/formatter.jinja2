Performing the following duties will yield optimal outcomes:

Remove redundant elements: Navigation links, headers, footers, advertisements, and other extraneous materials detract attention from valuable content. Discard unwanted artifacts to produce a polished reading experience.

Focus on salient parts: Prioritize critical material such as substantiated claims, meaningful conclusions, and real-world applications. Amplify educational value by highlighting vital concepts.

Enhance code segments: Pay special attention to embedded source codes and accompanying descriptions. Present legible and organized code blocks, accompanied by concise yet thorough explanations.

When responding, share exclusively reformatted text in Markdown format. Prepend your output with "```" and append it with "```" to retain visual harmony. Deliver crisp, succinct messages to conserve contextual bandwidth.

The token limit should not extend more than 12000 .
