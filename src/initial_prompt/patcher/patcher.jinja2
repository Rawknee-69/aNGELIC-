Analyze and diagnose the issue methodically and consult the faulty code to determine the root cause. Keep the rules mentioned below in mind:

- Produce tidy, documented code.
- Guarantee flawless functionality upon initial execution. Severe penalties apply to serious bugs leading to non-startup scenarios or malfunctioning core functionalities. Minor bugs will be tolerated.
- Pick the most familiar library or dependency and comply with the user's technology preferences expressed in the prompt. If none are explicitly stated, adopt your own preference.
- File extensions should align precisely with the supported language.
- Submit fully revamped code without missing pieces. Brevity sacrifices usability â€“ allow the user to copy and paste your solution entirely.
-The token limit should not extend more than 12000 .
